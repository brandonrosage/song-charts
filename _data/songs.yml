    [V]
    I just came in here from force of habit
    I don't intend to spend too much time in here
    But I saw you heading for the jukebox
    And if you play A-11, there'll be tears

    [Ch]
    I don't know you from Adam
    But if you're gonna play the jukebox
    Please don't play A-11

    [Turnaround]

    [V]
    Oh, this used to be our favorite nightspot
    And when she was here, it was heaven
    It was here; she told me that she loved me
    And she always played A-11

    [Intro]

    [Chorus]
    You've got to have an ace in the hole
    A little secret that nobody knows
    Life is a gamble, a game we all play
    But you need to save something for a rainy day

    You've got to learn to play your cards right
    If you expect to win in life
    Don't put it all on the line for just one roll
    You've got to have an ace in the hole

    [Verse]
    If you're headed down a one way street
    And you're not sure it's the way you wanna go
    In money or love or all the above
    Have a little more than what you show

    When life deals out a surprise
    Have a few surprises of your own
    No matter what you do, no matter where you go
    You've got to have an ace in the hole

    [Verse]
    My whole life's savings a two dollar bill
    That's why I'm here tonight I've got the time to kill
    And I can tell my story about twenty times
    With two dollars in the jukebox one dime at a time

    [Chorus]
    Two dollars in the jukebox a dime at a time
    Play the same old song about a love gone wrong till closing time
    Two dollars oughta do me if you'll buy the wine
    And I'll put in the jukebox one dime at a time

    [Verse]
    Pardon me mister mind if I sit down
    A misery loves company and I believe I've found
    Somebody just as lonely but don't believe I'm wrong
    If you had a place to go to you'd've done been gone

    It's another Saturday night down in San Antonio
    And I looked for you from the river walk to the Alamo
    I checked out all the hangouts but your whereabouts were unknown
    And it ain't no fun to be alone down in San Antone

    [Ch]
    I thought you were my San Antone rose
    And I was your hillbilly romeo
    The way that you held me I thought you'd never go
    But then you left me all alone down in San Antonio

    [Solo]

    [V]
    You said we could meet at the cafe' Carmalita
    So while I waited on you I had me a few margaritas
    Now it's closin' time and they're sayin'that I'm gonna have to be movin' on
    And it ain't no fun to be alone in San Antone

    A walkin' in a wearin' out leather, a scuffin' up the hardwood floor

    [Int]

    [V]
    We started out with good intentions, making love right there in the kitchen
    You and me were getting along just fine
    More than crazy about one another, I was your man, and you were my lover
    Glad that I was yours and you were mine

    [V]
    For awhile, I could do no wrong, you laughed at my jokes and you danced to the song
    Not too bad for an Amarillo country boy
    I said if we could just stay together, it could be just like this forever
    Finer things in life we would enjoy

    [Br]
    You told me you thought that I was wrong
    You said our love, it wouldn't last too long
    I don't want to leave you all alone
    So should I stay or should I go back home?

    [Ch]
    Am I right or Amarillo?
    Do I stay here with you or hit the road?
    Am I right or Amarillo?
    I love you, but I can always go back home

    [Solo over V]

    [V]
    Now pretty soon it was just like I figured, you told me that you'd reconsidered
    I could stay with you and be your man
    Now it seems there's a brand new problem, country boys learn their lessons when they're taught 'em
    I've learned about as much as I can stand

    [Br]
    Now I'm the one who thinks that I was wrong
    I don't think our love is gonna last too long
    I really, really, really hate to leave you all alone
    But Texas is a-calling me back home

    [Ch]

    [Out]
    Now It might be as flat as a pancake, but how much heartache can one man take
    Amarillo, we've been too long apart
    There's no need for me to keep on talking, if I'm a going, I'd better start walking
    Am I right or Amarillo never broke my heart

  Lyrics: |-
    [Int]

    [Ch]
    An empty glass, that last cigarette
    It's closing time, and I'm drunk again
    But somehow I'll make it home, and cry myself to sleep
    That's how my day ends, every night for me

    [Br]
    Every night I'm in some bar, pouring whiskey on a heart that's on fire
    Forgetting you is no easy thing, each night for me always ends the same

    [V]
    One by one they're turning out the lights
    I've been feedin' that ol' jukebox just to hold you tight
    I guess its for the best I just put in my last dime
    I heard you whisper "We'll meet again, another place, another time"

    [V]
    Chairs are stacked all over tables its closing time they say
    I could wait right here forever if they'd only let me stay
    Anywhere would be much better than that lonely room of mine
    Through a lonely night a waitin' for another place, another time

    [Ch]
    Won't that room of mine be a lonely place to be
    After I've been holding you so close to me
    Won't that old stairway be a little hard to climb
    To a lonely room waiting for another place, another time

    I just received your letter, you're down and out you say

    I'm going to give you another chance, to prove what you can be

    I was once so proud to have your love that I could burst with pride

    For days and nights I wonder and the reason I can't find
    There's so much love around me and no love to call mine

    In this world so full of love yet not enough to go around

    Well, I'm just a bartender and I don't like my work
    But I don't mind the money at all
    I've seen lots of sad faces and lots of bad cases
    Of folks with their backs to the wall

    [Chorus]
    But I need four walls around me, to hold my life
    To keep me from going astray
    And a honky tonk angel, to hold me tight
    To keep me from slipping away

    I can light up your smokes, I can laugh at your jokes
    I can watch you fall down on your knees
    I can close down this bar, I can gas up my car
    And I can pack up and mail in my keys

    [Chorus]

    Now the smoke fills the air in this honky tonk bar
    And I'm thinkin' 'bout where I'd rather be
    But I burned all my bridges and I sunk all my ships
    And I'm stranded at the edge of the sea

    Begging to you.

    I won't disappoint you...I'm beggin' to stay....
    But that's what you wanted...to hear any way...
    It must make you happy...to make me so blue...
    What a pitiful sight I...must be tonight begging to you.

    You don't want my loving...but you let me stay 'round...

    [V]
    Now just because you're pretty, and you think you're mighty wise
    You tell me that you love me, then you roll those big brown eyes
    You cuddle up so close to me, so gentle and so meek
    I know that you've been honky tonkin', haven't seen you for a week

    [Ch]
    Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me, I can tell you've been out on a spree
    It's plain that you're lyin' when you say that you've been cryin'
    Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me

    [Solo over Verse]

    [V]
    Now I used to spend my money to make you look real sweet
    I wanted to be proud of you when we walked down the street
    Now don't ask me to dress you up in satin and in silk
    Your eyes look like two cherries in a glass of buttermilk

    [Ch]
    [Solo over Verse]

    [V]
    Now I guess our little romance has finally simmered down
    You should join a circus, you'd make a real good clown
    Your eyes look like a roadmap, I'm scared to smell your breath
    You'd better shut your peepers before you bleed to death

    [A]
    I'll have a blue Christmas without you
    I'll be so blue just thinking about you
    Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
    Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me

    [B]
    And when those blue snowflakes start falling
    That's when those blue memories start calling
    You'll be doing all right with your Christmas of white
    But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

    Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
    Without a dream in my heart
    Without a love of my own

    [V]
    Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
    You heard me saying a prayer for
    Someone I really could care for

    [Ch]
    And then there suddenly appeared before me
    The only one my arms will hold
    I heard somebody whisper please adore me
    And when I looked to the moon it turned to gold

    [V]
    Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
    Without a dream in my heart
    Without a love of my own

    [Ch]
    Borrowed angel belongs to someone else
    I love my borrowed angel, I just cant help myself
    That ring on her finger don't belong to me
    But She loves me and I know she'll save some borrowed time for me

    I wish that I could have her more than just tonight

    At the bottom of the bottle is where a man can hide 
    When he must cross a river he knows is too wide 
    And the bottle is empty even heartaches are gone
    And though his eyes can't see no one, he don't feel alone 

    [Chorus]
    Come go with me to the bottom of the bottle
    On our way down we may meet fond memories
    I thought better from the bottom of the bottle
    Come join the man who she left so helplessly 

    [Turnaround]

    They all tell me that last night my baby came in 
    And she walked to my table to forgive me again 
    My eyes caught a memory and my mind tried in vain 
    I said your face looks familiar but I can't call your name

    I'd like to hold my head up and be proud of who I am
    But they won't let my secret go untold
    I paid the debt I owed them, but they're still not satisfied
    Now I'm a branded man out in the cold

    [V]
    When they let me out of prison, I held my head up high
    Determined, I would rise above the shame
    But no matter where I travel, the black mark follows me
    I'm branded with a number on my name

    [Ch]

    If I live to be a hundred, I guess I'll never clear my name

    Or they'll send me back to prison if I fail

  Lyrics: |-
    [Int]

    [V]
    She's in some honky tonk tonight I know
    She's dancing where the music's loud and lights're low
    In a crowded bar she likes to hang around
    And as long as there's a honky tonk she'll never settle down

    [Ch]
    So close up the honky tonks lock all the doors
    Don't let the one I love go there anymore
    Close up the honky tonks throw away the key
    Then maybe the one I love will come back to me

    [Solo over Chorus]

    [V]
    I wish I had the power to turn back the time
    And live again the hours when she was all mine
    But it hurts to see her running with that crowd downtown
    And as long as there's a honky tonk she'll never settle down

    [V]
    I've tried so hard, my dear to show that you're my every dream
    Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
    A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
    Why can't I free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold, cold heart?

    [V]
    Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
    And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
    In anger, unkind words are said that made the teardrops start
    Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

    But darling who's the stranger at our door

    [Verse 2]
    As I walked in you said goodbye and began to walk away
    I held you close and I begged you not to go
    But I was holdin' a stranger that had a lot to say
    And darling you've never said those things before

    [Chorus]
    Darling who's the stranger at our door
    She's saying all those things that I've never heard before
    Things you wouldn't think of things I can't believe
    Darling please tell your friend to leave

    Well, I've heard those city singers singing 'bout how they can love
    Deeper than the oceans, higher than the stars above

    [V]
    But I come from the country and I know I ain't seen it all
    But I heard that ocean's salty, and the stars they sometimes fall

    [Pc]
    And that would not do justice to the way I feel for you
    So I had to sing this song about all the things I knew

    [Ch]
    My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the river
    Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
    My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December
    And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
    And longer than the song of a whippoorwill

    [T/A]

    [V]
    From the back roads to the Broadway shows with a million miles between
    There's at least a million love songs that people love to sing

    [Pc]
    And every one is different, and every one's the same
    And this is just another way of saying the same thing

    I'm a drivin' this truck for a mountain road
    I got a hot rod rig and I'm a flyin' low
    My eyes're filled with diesel smoke, hair pin curves ain't no joke
    Diesel smoke, Dangerous curves

    I was out last night drinkin' beer with the guys
    Got an achin' head and blood shot eyes
    I ended up with a pretty little dame I didn't even know her name
    Diesel smoke, Dangerous curves

    If I deliver this hot shot freight
    I gotta get a goin' cause I'm runnin' late
    These mountain grades are mighty steep
    Can't stay awake, I ain't had no sleep
    Diesel smoke, Dangerous curves

    [Instrumental]

    There's a cute little waitress at the bottom of the grades
    She's got the coffee already made
    I gotta keep my eyes upon the road
    Cause I'm goin' down the hill with a heavy load
    Diesel smoke, Dangerous curves

    Well I must have closed my eyes for a while
    Cause here I am and I'm a runnin' wild
    I burnt my brakes stripped my gears gonna have to ride her down I fear
    Diesel smoke, Dangerous curves

    I wish I'd left the wind alone but
    It's too late now cause I think I'm gone
    I got myself into this fix just because I tried to mix
    Diesel smoke, Dangerous curves

    I'm drinking champagne, feelin' no pain till early mornin'
    Dinin' and dancin' with every pretty girl I can find
    I'm having a fling with a pretty young thing till early mornin'
    Knowin' tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind

    [Br]
    Guilty conscience I guess, though I must confess
    I never loved you much when you were mine

    When I begin to realize
    I've cried so much since you've been gone
    I guess I'll drown in my own tears

    Everytime I'm kissing you, I think of you kissing him

    I came home and I found you in the arms of a friend
    I should have turned and walked away when I saw you kissing him
    You beg me to forgive you, but I wonder if I can
    'Cause everytime I'm kissing you, I think of you kissing him

    [Ch]
    You even said you were ashamed, but it hurts me just the same
    And I'll have to pay the cost, 'cause I can't hold the love that's lost
    I thought I was the only one, but you don't know the harm you've done
    'Cause everytime I'm kissing you, I think of you kissing him

    Fifteen years together we climbed by work and will
    From a simple two room cottage to a mansion on the hill
    Now, there's roses in the garden, but it's the coldest place in town
    It took fifteen years goin' up, but one night comin' down

    [Chorus]
    Fifteen years of heaven for one short night of sin
    From blue skies forever to an end
    From high on a mountain to both knees on the ground
    Fifteen years goin' up, and one night comin' down

    [Verse]
    Her dreams have all been shattered, her faith in me is gone

    After fifteen years goin' up, it's hard to take a fall

    [T/A]

    I hear the train a comin', it's rolling round the bend
    And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
    I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
    But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

    When I was just a baby, my mama told me "son"
    "Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"
    But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
    When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry

    [Solo]

    I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
    They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
    Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
    But those people keep on movin'
    And that's what tortures me

    Well if they freed me from this prison
    If that railroad train was mine
    I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
    Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
    And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

    You may think that I'm talkin' foolish
    You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free

    This love that I feel for you always will be

    But you're not just time that I'm killin'
    I'm no longer one of those guys
    As sure as I live, this love that I give
    Is gonna be yours until the day that I die

    [Chorus]
    Oh, baby, I'm gonna love you forever
    Forever and ever amen
    As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
    As long as old women sit and talk about old men
    If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
    I'll be happy to tell you again
    I'm gonna love you forever and ever

    They say time can play tricks on a memory
    Make people forget things they knew
    Well, it's easy to see, it's happenin' to me
    I've already forgotten every woman but you

    Fly me to the moon, Let me play among the stars
    Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars
    In other words, hold my hand
    In other words, baby, kiss me

    [A]
    Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore
    You are all I long for, All I worship and adore
    In other words, please be true
    In other words, I love you

    From a Jack to a King, from loneliness to a wedding ring
    I played an Ace and I won a Queen, and walked away with your heart

    [V]
    From a Jack to a King, with no regret I stacked the cards last night
    And lady luck played her hand just right, to make me King of your heart

    [Br]
    For just a little while I thought that I might lose the game
    Then just in time I saw the twinkle in your eye

    [V]
    From a Jack to a King, from loneliness to a wedding ring
    I played an Ace and I won a Queen, you made me King of your heart

    [Int]

    [V]
    Oh, me and my baby are goin' steady. We ain't married but we're gettin' ready
    To tie the knot, and I'm gonna make her my own.
    Now that I've found her I'm gonna keep her; Finders keepers, losers weepers,
    She's my baby, she's goin' steady with me.

    [Ch]
    Well, I've been honky tonkin' 'round nearly all my life,
    But now I've got a steady babe, and I'm gonna make her my wife.
    All you Rovin' Ramblers can leave her alone, Don't even try to date her on the phone
    'Cause she's my baby, she's goin' steady with me.

    [Solo over Verse]

    [V]
    Well, now, sweet baby, that we're goin' steady, I'll pull up and ask your daddy
    What he thinks, if you and I are wed.
    'Cause I love you and you love me, We're both as happy as we can be,
    And I hope your daddy will let you go steady with me.

    [Ch]
    We'll get the ring, then be on our way to see the preacher man,
    And when I say: "I do, sweetheart!" I'll slip the ring on your lovin' hand
    Every thing's gonna turn out fine, I'll be yours and you'll be mine,
    'Cause you're my baby, you're Goin' Steady with me.

    I love the brunets the red heads and blonde haired gals, yeah I done it since I don't know when

    [Verse]
    The old hometown looks the same, as I step down from the train
    And there to meet me is my mama and papa
    Down the road I look and there runs Mary, hair of gold and lips like cherries
    It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

    [Chorus]
    Yes, they'll all come to meet me
    Arms reaching, smiling sweetly
    It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

    [Verse]
    The old house is still standing, though the paint is cracked and dry
    And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
    Down the lane, I walk with my sweet Mary, hair of gold and lips like cherries
    It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

    [Chorus, modulate up whole step]

    [Verse]
    Then I awake and look around me at four grey walls that surround me
    And I realize, yes, I was only dreaming
    For there's a guard and there's a sad, old padre, arm in arm, we'll walk at daybreak
    Again, I'll touch the green, green grass of home

    [Outro]
    Yes, they'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree
    As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home

    One fool on a stool is what I heard the bartender say.
    I never thought my own life would ever turn out this way...
    Green snakes on the ceiling, Walking walls I can see.
    One fool on a stool and on this stool sits this fool me.

    [V: 2/4 shuffle]
    One fool on a stool, one drink to a hand.
    No thread for your needle, no mam, I ain't seen your man.

    Just order your drink, I'll make room for more.

    There ain't no glamour in this tinseled land of lost and wasted lives

    By the time I count from one to four, I hear her (KNOCK) on my door

    In the evening when the sun goes down, when there is nobody else around
    She kisses me and she holds me tight, and tells me, "Daddy, everything's all right"

    My future tightly clutched within those healing hands of time

    They let me close my eyes just then, those healing hands of time
    And soon they'll let me sleep again, those healing hands of time
    Already I've reached mountain peaks and I've just begun to climb
    I'll get over you by clinging to those healing hands of time

    And heartache number two was when you came back again
    You came back and never meant to stay

    [Ch]
    Now I've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
    Everyday you love me less, each day I love you more
    Yes, I've got heartaches by the number
    A love that I can't win
    But the day that I stop counting
    That's the day my world will end

    [Solo]

    [V]
    Heartache number three Was when you called me
    And said that you was coming back to stay
    With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
    I waited but you must have lost your way

  Lyrics: |-
    Well, since my baby left me, I found a new place to dwell
    It's down at the end of Lonely Street at Heartbreak Hotel
    Where I'll be, I'll be so lonely, baby, I'm so lonely
    I'll be so lonely, I could die

    Although it's always crowded, you still can find some room
    For broken hearted lovers to cry there in their gloom
    Be so, they'll be so lonely, baby, they get so lonely
    They're so lonely, they could die

    Now, the bellhop's tears keep flowin', and the desk clerk's dressed in black
    Well, they've been so long on Lonely Street, they'll never look back
    And they get so, they get so lonely, baby, they are so lonely
    They're so lonely, they could die

    Well, if your baby leaves you, and you got a tale to tell
    Just take a walk down Lonely Street to Heartbreak Hotel
    Where you will be, you will be lonely, baby, you will be lonely
    You'll be so lonely, you could die

    [Solo]

    I love you so much that I can't leave you
    Even though my mind tells me I should
    But then you make me think that you still love me
    And all my thoughts of leavin' do no good

    [Ch]
    You've got me, heart over mind, worried all the time
    Knowin' you will always be the same
    You'll keep hurting me I know but I still can't let you go
    'Cause my heart won't let my love for you change

    [Solo over Verse]

    [V]
    Friends tell me they see you out with others
    In my heart I try hard to forget
    Then you come home and tell me you still love me
    I hope there's some chance for us yet

    Just to know it means so much to me

    I'm doin' alright except I can't sleep, and I cry all night 'til dawn
    What I'm trying to say is I love you and I miss you
    And I'm so sorry that I did you wrong

    [Solo]

    [A]
    Look up darlin', let me kiss you; just for old time sake
    Let me hold you in my arms one more time
    Thank you darlin', may God bless you, and may each step you take
    Bring you closer to the things you seek to find

    [B]
    Goodbye darlin', gotta go now, gotta try to find a way
    To lose these memories of a love so warm and true
    And if you should ever find it in your heart to forgive me
    Come back Darlin', I'll be waitin' for you...

    We'll make a cup of coffee and you can rest your shoes

    But I'd rather have a little bit of trouble than to never know the love you give

    To live in memory of such an old lonesome time
    I can't stop wanting you, it's useless to say
    So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday

    [V]
    Those happy hours that we once knew
    Though long ago, they still make me blue
    They say that time heals a broken heart
    But time has stood still since we've been apart

    [A]
    It don't hurt anymore. All my teardrops are dried
    No more walkin' the floor, with that burnin' inside
    Just to think it could be, time has opened the door
    And at last I am free, I don't hurt anymore

    [B]
    No use to deny I wanted to die, the day you said we were through
    But now that I find you're out of my mind, I can't believe that it's true
    I've forgotten somehow, that I cared so before
    And it's wonderful now, I don't hurt anymore

    I fall to pieces
    Each time I see you again
    I fall to pieces
    How can I be just your friend?

    [Ch]
    You want me to act like we've never kissed
    You want me to forget, pretend we've never met
    And I've tried and I've tried, but I haven't yet
    You walk by and I fall to pieces

    [V]
    I fall to pieces
    Each time someone speaks your name
    I fall to pieces
    Time only adds to the flame

    Someone who love me too, the way you used to do
    But each time I go out with someone new
    You walk by and I fall to pieces

    If we make it through December
    Got plans to be in a warmer town come summer time
    Maybe even California
    If we make it through December, we'll be fine

    Got laid off down at the factory
    And there time is not the greatest in the world
    Heaven knows I've been workin' hard
    I wanted Christmas to be right for daddy's girl

    I don't mean to hate December
    It's meant to be the happy time of year
    And my little girl don't understand
    Why daddy can't afford no Christmas gift

    If we make it through December
    Everything's gonna be alright, I know
    It's the coldest time of winter
    And I shiver when I see the falling snow

    Got plans to be in a warmer town come summer time

    You'd stop at hundred and forty tears I forget the lonely years

    If you should come back I wonder what I'd act like
    I wonder what I'd do I wonder what I'd say
    I know that I do more than stand and smile while my crazy arms went wild

    I hardly knew it was you

    You once said that you would have no one 
    Now no one will ever have you
    A life of hardship and disgrace 
    I see it written on your face 
    I hardly knew it was you

    [Solo over A]

    Custom jewels and cheap perfume 
    you're like a rose that's lost its bloom
    I hardly knew it was you
    From the simple girl I knew 
    you have changed dear through and through
    I hardly knew it was you

    We could have lived our lives together 
    but your heart had a mind all its own
    What a pity what a shame 
    I don't know who's to blame
    But I hardly knew it was you

    The one I love don't want me hanging round

    Tonight she's with a stranger at a party in her home
    And I'm here at a tavern gettin' stoned

    Cause if I gotta go I'll go down swinging
    Where there's lights and laughter booze and blonds and a lot of sad sad singing
    I'll sober up tomorrow and cry all day I know
    At least I'll go down swinging what a swinging way to go

    I love you more today, than he can from now on

    [V]
    I've kissed your tears away when you were sad
    Held you close, felt your warm love when you were glad
    So, no matter how much love he has for you or how long
    I love you more today, than he can from now on

    [Ch]
    We've already done the things he plans to do
    So don't be surprised if late at night I'm in your dreams with you
    And if someday his love for you goes wrong
    I love you more today, than he can from now on

    [V]
    When shadows fall I'm twice as lonely 
    How I miss my one and only
    Gone tonight like many nights before
    Ever since the day I found her 
    All my world's been built around her
    Just like before, she's hurt me once more
    And I'm walking the floor

    [Ch]
    Walking slow and thinking bout her 
    How long can I live without her
    Teardrops dim these eyes that watch the door
    Though I've got this heartsick feeling 
    Still I hope that she'll come stealing
    Back through the door, like always before
    I'll forgive her once more, and stop walking the floor

    I can't stand to see a good man go to waste
    One who never combs his hair or shaves his face
    A man who leans on wine over love that's told a lie
    Oh, it tears me up to see a grown man cry

    [Chorus]
    So I never go around mirrors
    I can't stand to see me without you by my side
    No, I never go around mirrors
    Because I gotta heartache to hide

    [Solo]

    I can't stand to be where heartaches hang around
    It's so easy for the blues to get me down
    To see a grown man crawl is more than I can stand
    And I look into the eyes of half a man

    [Chorus]

    Oh, it tears me up to see a grown man cry

    That the love light in your eyes
    Forever will shine

    'Til the roses turn to ashes
    'Til the organ turns to rust
    If you never come I'll still be there
    'Til the moonlight turns to dust
    How I'd love to hear the choir

    As they sing "Oh Promise Me"

    It's four in the morning and once more the dawning

    Wishing I'd never met her, knowing if I'd forget her
    How much better off she would be

    [Ch]
    The longer I hold on and the longer this goes on
    The harder that it's gonna be
    But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning

    I've never deserved her, God knows when I hurt her
    That's the last thing that I want to do
    She tries but she can't tell how she feels
    But I know too well what she's going through

    [Ch]
    If I love her so much I don't know why I can't do
    The right thing and just let her be

    [Ch]

    One more drink Joe, then I gotta go home

    Well, I called my baby and I told her to be, down at the juke joint a-waitin' for me
    'Cause I'm a juke joint Johnny, I know every joint in town
    I'm a juke joint Johnny, and I'm always jukin' around

    Now, I work all weekend and I draw my pay, I hit a juke joint and I throw it all away
    'Cause I'm a juke joint Johnny, I guess I'll always be
    I'm a juke joint Johnny, and a juke joint is home to me

    [Solo]

    Now I can dance all night to a juke joint song, when the sun comes up I'm still goin' strong
    'Cause I'm a juke joint Johnny, yeah, now watch me go
    I'm a juke joint Johnny, and baby, you're steppin' slow

    [Solo]

    These lonesome blues don't bother me none, 'cause I know every gal that wants to have fun
    'Cause I'm a juke joint Johnny, there ain't no flies on me
    I'm a juke joint Johnny, And a juke joint is where I'll be

    [Solo]

    Well, I told my gal I just couldn't stay, she wants to marry, but I wants to play
    'Cause I'm a juke joint Johnny, I like to go all the time
    I'm a juke joint Johnny, and I juke on down the line

    Whenever I've chance to meet, some old friends on the street
    They wonder how does a man get to be this way
    I've always got a smilin' face, any time and any place
    And every time they ask me why, I just smile and say

    [Ch]
    You've got to kiss an angel good mornin'
    And let her know you think about her when you're gone
    Kiss an angel good mornin'
    And love her like the devil when you get back home

    [V]
    Well, people may try to guess the secret of a happiness
    But some of them never learn, it's a simple thing
    The secret I'm speakin' of is a woman and a man in love
    And the answer is in this song that I always sing

    Now I'm lying here with Linda on my mind
    And next to me, my soon to be, the one I left behind
    And Lord it's killing me to see her crying
    She knows I'm lying here beside her with Linda on my mind.

    [V]
    Yes I know that I once loved her, and I placed no one above her
    And I never thought I'd ever set her free
    But it just wasn't in my plan the way Linda squeezed my hand
    The first time that I held her close as she danced with me.

    [Bridge]
    She said I've loved you for a long time, but you're married to a friend of mine
    And I tried hard to never let it show
    But my love for you is stronger
    I can't hide it any longer
    And so I thought I'd better let you know.

  Lyrics: |-
    [A]
    Look out, heart, you're gonna get broken
    Look out, dream, you're fadin' away
    Look out, love, if you don't watch it
    Gonna find yourself growin' wings and flyin' away
     
    [B]
    Well, you can't say that I didn't warn you
    But you never would listen right from the start
    Gonna tell you once more, though you already know it
    Don't you know you better watch it, duck it, dodge it, look out, heart

    [C]
    If you keep on the way that you're goin', you just don't have a chance
    Gotta keep both eyes wide open if you're ever gonna find romance
    Pretty close to me, so we'll make a new start
    If you don't watch it, she's gonna break you, look out, heart

    [Solo over B]

    [A]
    Look out, tears, you're gonna start fallin'
    Look out, lips, you'll never get a kiss
    Look out, arms, you're never gonna hold her
    Don't you know I wouldn't lie about a thing like this

    [B]
    Now, you fell hard and you're still a-fallin'
    But one of these days you're gonna pull up sharp
    Before you hit the ground, this is my last warnin'
    She's a-gonna hurt you, beat you, break you, look out, heart

    [C]

    Treat me like a fool, Treat me mean and cruel, but love me
    Bring my faithful heart, tear it all apart, but love me
    If you ever go, darling, I'll be oh, so lonely
    I'll be sad and blue, crying over you, dear only

    [Br]
    I would beg and steal, just to feel
    Your heart beating close to mine
    If you ever go, darling, I'll be oh, so lonely

    Now there's a little place that I know about
    I go there with my baby everytime I take her out
    We park by the rock and watch the lights down below
    And I tell her things that she ought to know

    [Ch]
    They call it Lover's rock, they call it Lover's rock
    Well, everybody's rockin' and there's very little talkin'
    Just a-huggin' and a-kissin' goin' on

    [Solo]

    [Verse]
    I just can't wait for Saturday night
    We'll park by the rock in the pale moonlight
    I'll grab my baby and steal a kiss and then
    I know she'll be stealin' it right back again

    [Chorus]

    [Solo]

    [Verse]
    Well, everybody's got a little place they call their own
    Where they can always go when they wanna be alone
    Lover's rock is the best around
    It's a short way up but it's a long way down

    *Yes it's real gone

    Hand you my lovin', you know what I mean, feels so bad I built a lovin' machine
    Up to my house, I'll show you what I mean
    Well I just got wise and built me a lovin' machine

    Well you put a nickel in the slot, you hear sounds buzzin', kisses wild and hot, five cents a dozen
    Up to my house, I've got something you've never seen
    Well I got hip to the tip and built me a lovin' machine

    Well you pull the lever on the right, two arms jump out, wrap all around you, make you scream and shout
    Up to my house, I've got something you've never seen
    I just built me a brand new lovin' machine

    [Instrumental]

    You put a quarter in the slot, things light up, out comes your lovin' in a Dixie cup
    Up to my house, I've got something you've never seen
    I got wise to myself and built me a lovin' machine

    Well it will love you all day, if you feel run down, you don't have to worry, run all over town
    When my machine finishes, that ain't all, out comes a bottle of Hadocol
    Up to my house, try my lovin' machine

    [Outro]
    Well after twenty-four hours you'll know just what I mean

    I'm praying for rain in California
    So the grapes can grow and they can make more wine
    And I'm a sittin' at a honky'n in Chicago
    With a broken heart and a woman on my mind

    [Ch]
    I match the man behind a bar for the jukebox
    And the music takes me back to Tennessee
    When they ask who's the fool in the corner cryin'
    I say a little ole wine drinker me

    [V]
    I came here last week from down in Nashville
    Cause my baby left for Florida on a train
    And I thought I'd get a job and just forget her
    But in Chicago a broken heart is still the same

    She's out there somewhere but I don't really care
    I'm glad to say that we had just a casual affair.
    We drifted together then drifted apart
    And I crossed her name from my heart

    But I'm lying again, just lying again
    One kiss from her could start me sighing again
    If you could see behind this game of pretend
    You'd see my heart crying, I've been lying again

    [Instrumental over Chorus]

    [Modulate up a half step; Verse]
    If she ever phones just say that I am not home
    Just tell her I'm busy and please leave me alone
    I hope she's happy, for I plan to be
    And she's just a memory to me

    [Int]

    [V]
    The first thing I remember knowing, was a lonesome whistle blowing
    And a young'un's dream of growing up to ride
    On a freight train leaving town, not knowing where I'm bound
    And no one could change my mind, but Mama tried

    [V]
    One and only rebel child, from a family meek and mild
    My mama seemed to know what lay in store
    Despite all my Sunday learning, towards the bad I kept on turning
    Till Mama couldn't hold me anymore

    [Ch]
    And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
    No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
    Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
    That leaves only me to blame 'cause Mama tried

    [T/A]
    [Solo]

    [V]
    Dear old Daddy, rest his soul, left my mom a heavy load
    She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
    Working hours without rest, wanted me to have the best
    She tried to raise me right, but I refused

    I just got your letter baby, too bad you can't come home
    I swear I'm going crazy sitting here all alone
    Since you're gone, I got a mess of blues

    I ain't slept a wink since Sunday, I can't eat a thing all day
    Every day is just blue Monday since you've been away
    Since you're gone, I got a mess of blues

    If you cry when you're in love, it sure ain't no disgrace

  Lyrics: |-
    [Int]

    [V]
    When my baby moved out and the blues moved in, there wasn't nothin' I could do
    But mosey around with my head in my hands, Lord what am I comin' to
    I just keep moanin', moanin' the blues

    [Br]
    I wrote a nice long letter, sayin' mama please come home
    Your daddy is lonesome, and all I do is moan

    I been lovin' that gal for so doggone long, I can't afford to lose her now
    I thought I was right but I must’ve been wrong, 'cause my head is startin' to bow
    And now I'm moanin', moanin' the blues

    [Solo over Br + V]

    [V]
    If you want a good gal to stay around, you gotta treat her nice and kind
    If you do her wrong she'll leave this town, and you'll almost lose your mind
    Then you'll be moanin', moanin' the blues

    [Br]
    Baby, baby, baby. Honey baby, please come home
    Your daddy is lonesome, and all I do is moan

    [V]
    I promise you baby that I'll be good, and I'll never be bad no more
    I'm sittin' here waitin' for you right now to walk through that front door
    Then I'll stop moanin', moanin' the blues

    Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, men have named you
    You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
    Is it only 'cause you're lonely they have blamed you?
    For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile?

    [B]
    Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa?
    Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
    Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
    They just lie there and they die there
    Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?
    Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?

    [Instrumental over B]

    [A]
    Well, in a villa in a lttle old Italian town
    Lives a girl whose beauty shames a rose
    Many dreams have been brought to her, they all tumble down
    What does she want, nobody knows

    [A]
    Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, men have named you
    You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
    Is it only 'cause you're lonely they have blamed you?
    For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile?

    Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance
    With the stars up above in your eyes
    A fantabulous night to make romance
    'Neath the cover of October skies

    [A]
    And all the leaves on the trees are falling
    To the sound of the breezes that blow
    You know I'm tryin' to please to the calling
    Of your heartstrings that play soft and low

    [B]
    You know the night's magic seems to whisper and hush
    You know the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush
    Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?
    Can I just make some more romance with a-you, my love?

    [A]
    Well, I wanna make love to you tonight
    I can't wait 'til the mornin' has come
    You know, I know now the time is just right
    And straight into my arms you will run

    [A]
    And when you come, my heart will be waiting
    To make sure that you're never alone
    There and then all my dreams will come true, dear
    There and then I will make you my own

    [B]
    And every time I touch you, you just tremble inside
    And I know how much you want me, that you can't hide
    Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?
    Can I just make some more romance with a-you, my love?

    Now and then an old friend tries to help me

    Hey, but I don't have the heart to start all over

    [Ch]
    You just don't put new patches on old garments
    I don't want no one else on my mind
    I just don't need nobody new to cling to
    I still love someone I've known a long, long time

    [T/A; ^modulate up 1/2 step]

    And she's the only one that I let in

    In my mind I'm loving her again

    [V]
    Pardon me, if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye
    Don't be angry with me should I cry
    I'm a fool, but I love you dear until the day I die
    Now and then there's a fool such as I

    [Ch]
    Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
    You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through
    I'm a fool, but I'll love you dear until the day I die
    Now and then there's a fool such as I

    I got a one track minded baby. It’s me that’s on her mind.
    Every time I step out of her sight, my baby she starts a’cryin.
    Well, how could it be that simple me could have a love like this?
    I got a one track minded baby. And I’m at the top of her list.

    [T/A]

    [V]
    Now, when we go out ‘a dancin’, she holds me oh so tight.
    She ain’t out cooin’ with other men. I’m hers for the night.
    Then, how could it be that simple me could have this love divine?
    I got a one track minded baby. And it’s me that’s on her mind.

    [Solo over V]

    [Br]
    I can’t even walk in my own house when my baby’s layin’ down.
    At the slightest step up, well, up she gets just to follow me around.
    I got a one track minded baby. It’s me that’s on her mind.
    I got a one track minded baby. And she wants me all of the time.

    You make my heart beat until it's sounding like it's on overtime
    The chill of winter goes up and down me and it's still summer time
    And why am I walking way up on this cloud so high?
    Have I grown wings to fly? Or is it love?

    [Turnaround]

    Each time you touch me, that little tingle goes up and down my spine
    I feel a trembling on my lips when you press yours to mine
    And these butterflies won't let me eat at supper time
    Have I lost my mind? Or is it love?

    She was wandering too, when her eye caught mine
    In the panhandle town along the border line

    Well the night was cold and dreary, and the rain that was a-falling sure was falling fast
    And I was getting leery 'cause I'd left another dearie In a town I'd passed
    But I'll never more roam from this border town
    'Cause I married that gal and then we settled down

    Every time it rains, it rains pennies from heaven
    And don't you know each cloud contains pennies from heaven?
    You'll find your fortune falling all over the town
    Be sure that your umbrella is upside down

    [B]
    Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
    If you want the things you love, you must have showers
    So, when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
    There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me

    You know that you're doing lots of things that ain't right

    [Solo over Ch]

    [V]
    I'd be so much better off to drive you from my mind
    And make you the memories that I'd like to leave behind
    I know that these heartaches are what you will put me through
    So why do I have these doubts about leaving you

    Red, red wine and cheatin' songs
    Lately this bar room's where I call my home
    Somewhere, somehow, my baby went wrong
    Now it's red, red wine and cheatin' songs

    [T/A]

    [V]
    For ten long years, not one single drop
    Twelve months later, well I haven't stopped
    I'm covering the misery of a good love grown cold
    And losing what's left of my mind and soul to that

    [Ch]

    [Solo]

    [V]
    Cigarette smoke, powder and pain
    Can't make up for what is and what ain't
    When the truth starts to rumble and it starts to roar
    Then I ask the barmaid to pour me some more of that

    A song of old San Antone
    Where in dreams I live with a memory
    Beneath the stars, all alone

    It was there I found, beside the Alamo
    Enchantments strange as the blue up above
    For that moonlit pass, that only she would know
    Still hears my broken song of love

    [B]
    Moon in all your splendor, known only to my heart
    Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
    Lips so sweet and tender, like petals falling apart
    Speak once again of my love, my own

    [A]
    Broken song, empty words I know
    Still live in my heart all alone
    For that moonlit pass beside the Alamo
    And rose, my rose of San Antone

    Santa's been checkin', checkin' all around the world, wants to know what's goin' on with every single boy and girl
    Said, great gosh, Almighty, much to my surprise, nobody's been naughty, everybody's been nice
    Now Santa likes to boogie, Santa likes to dance, Santa likes to rock it, likes to go real fast
    Santa likes to ride in a boogie woogie choo choo, train

    Santa's got the elves workin' workin' overtime, he's doubled up production on the toy production line
    He says there's too much stuff this year to carry in the sleigh; got to get a better plan, got to find a better way
    We got toys for the boys and they're all over the place, got 'em stacked in the ceiling, gotta stick it in your face
    He says that this year we're gonna take the boogie woogie choo choo train

    [Chorus]
    Santa Claus is comin', Santa Claus is comin'
    Santa Claus is comin' in a boogie, woogie, choo, choo, train
    We got toys for the boys and they're all over the place, got 'em stacked in the ceiling, gotta stick it in your face
    Sants Claus is coming in a boogie, woogie, choo, choo, train

    Rudolph says, wait a minute, what about me? Don't leave me sittin' all alone at home on Christmas Eve
    Santa said no way, man, we gotta have your nose to show us all the way, to show us where to go
    We got Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen, Comet and Cupid, Donner and Blitzen
    We all goin' ridin' in a boogie, woogie, choo, choo, train

    Sunshine of your eyes, oh, me, oh, my

  Lyrics: |-
    [A]
    I have a story I'd like to tell, broken heart's know it only too well
    And she knows why I feel the way I do
    She gave me all her love and then she took it away, blue sky has turned to a solid grey
    And she knows why I feel the way I do

    [B]
    Well, I know I'm a walkin' down the lovesick trails, been walked down by many before
    But when she sees my side of tracks, she'll know I've learned the score
    I'll pick my tears put 'em on the shelf, keep my heartaches to myself
    'Cause she knows why I feel the way I do

    [Solo over A]

    [A]
    When she finds somebody new, then he'll find out what I went through
    'Cause she knows why I feel the way I do
    She gave me her love and then she took it away, blue skies had turned to a solid grey
    And she knows why I feel the way I do

    [V]
    I've seen men look at her before aand they think, I don't see
    I'd like to think it makes me proud, but I'm only fooling me
    I know she'll be lookin' back the minute I'm not there
    While she pours herself on some stranger, I pour myself a drink somewhere

    [Ch]
    She's actin' single, I'm drinkin' double
    I hide my pain, I drown my troubles
    My heart is breaking, like the tiny bubbles
    She's actin' single, I'm drinkin' doubles

    [V]
    I know all she plans to do, but I don't know where or when
    If I ask who that stranger was, she'll just say, "an old friend"
    I'm not weak, I tell myself I stay because I'm strong
    The truth is I'm not man enough, to stop her from doing me wrong

    She's my fingers when I want to feel
    She's the only thing in life to me that's really real
    She is love, she's all the love I know
    She could kiss the ground in the wintertime
    And make the flower grow

    She’s wearing blue again
    Someone’s untrue again
    Why can’t she see how much I care
    Someone's caused her pain
    It’s happening once again
    It’s too much for my heart to bear

    [V]
    I tried to let her know
    How much I love her so
    But she doesn’t care how my poor heart aches
    Watching her make mistakes
    Now she’s the fool for me

    She knows it won’t stand a chance
    All her dreams come crashing down
    It’s always some fickle guy
    Now that’s the fool for me

    My baby's long and tall, she's like a cannonball
    Say, everytime she loves me, Lordy, you can hear me squall
    She cried, "Ooh-wee." I believe I'll change my mind
    She said, "I'm so glad I'm living." I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"

    [V]
    My baby knows just how to treat me right
    Gives me plenty loving morning, noon, and night
    She cried, "Ooh-wee." I believe I'll change my mind
    She said, "I'm so glad I'm living." I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"

    [Solo]

    When my baby does what she does to me
    I climb the highest mountain, dive in the deepest sea
    She cried, "Ooh-wee." I believe I'll change my mind
    She said, "I'm so glad I'm living." I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"

    [Solo]

    [V]
    My baby's lips are red, like cherry wine
    When she kisses me I get high all the time
    She cried, "Ooh-wee." I believe I'll change my mind
    She said, "I'm so glad I'm living." I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"

    [Instrumental x1]

    I came here looking for something
    I couldn't find anywhere else
    Hey, I'm not tryin' to be nobody
    I just wanna change to be myself

    I've spent a thousand miles of thumbin'
    Yes, I've worn blisters on my heels
    Trying to find me something better
    Here on the streets of Bakersfield

    [Chorus]
    You don't know me, but you don't like me
    Say you care less how I feel
    But how many of you have sit and judged me
    Ever walked the streets of Bakersfield?

    [Instrumental x2]

    Spent some time in San Francisco
    I spent a night there in the can
    They threw this drunk man in my jail cell
    I took fifteen dollars from that man

    Left him my watch and my old house key
    Don't want folks thinkin' that I'd steal
    Then I thanked him as I was leaving
    And I headed out for Bakersfield

    I’m dreaming sweet dreams of all the loving I’ll get

    Oh I might as well be talking to the wall

    [V]

    So I finally found the strength to say goodbye
    Why already I forgot a million memories
    And leaving you was easy as could be

    [Ch]
    But I might as well be talking to the wall 
    When I tell myself I'm not missing you at all
    'Cause every time you come around I fall 
    And...I...might as well be talking to the wall

    It seems there's not a day that some friend of mine
    Won't bring back a memory I'll recall

    And I hardly remember her at all

    Tattle tale tears 
    Are telling on you 
    More than a thousand tongues 
    Could ever do

    Tattle tale tears 
    That you try to hide 
    Are telling that you're the one 
    who's crying inside

    [B]
    While you were pettin' 
    You kept forgettin' the tables can turn
    And that others 
    Can find someone new

    Now you're alone 
    With no one to phone 
    And tattle tale tears 
    Are telling on you

    [A]
    You've got something hard to find boy
    Someone true standing by your side
    I still regret the very day I let go of the one I love
    Be thankful for the angel God sent you from above

    [V]
    If that woman is the apple of your eye boy
    Why do you always make her cry?
    I still regret the very day my foolish heart went out to play
    Tell her that you love her, don't let her go away

    [Ch]
    Tell her that you love her in the morning when you wake
    Tell her that you need her before it's too late
    I still regret the very day I let go of the one I love
    Be thankful for the angel God sent you from above

    I used to spend my nights out in a barroom
    Liquor was the only love I'd known
    But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
    And brought me back from being too far gone

    [Ch]
    You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
    You're as sweet as strawberry wine
    You're as warm as a glass of brandy
    And I stay stoned on your love all the time

    [V]
    I've looked for love in all the same old places
    Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
    But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
    'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high

    [Ch]

    [Out]
    And I stay stoned on your love all the time

  Lyrics: |-
    I heard a lonely coyote a-howling for his mate
    I took the blues and packed my shoes and left the Lone Star state
    I thought if I could ride away I would lose the blues
    But I found out that Texas soil is sticking to my shoes
    I′m heading back I got the Texas blues

    [Solo]

    I don't know why it happens when I open up my mouth
    Some critter looks and hollers, "Hey, are you from the south?"
    They laugh at all my how-you-all′s each time that I speak
    And what's more this foreign soil is burning both my feet
    I'm heading back I got the Texas blues

    [Solo]

    They showed me all their cities with their buildings way up high
    They′re built that way to swing and sway and dust out all the sky
    They got me out of Texas so I could really see
    Hey, but they′ll play the dickens getting Texas out of me
    I'm heading back I got the Texas blues

    Well, it won't be long now until that 'ol sun goes down

    [Ch]
    It's a shame she wears the name of a man who's locked and chained
    To a bottle that's destroyin' all hopes and cares

    I want your love not your money
    Your money can;t buy my love at all

    [Solos over A]

    [B]

    [A]
    You know what I like, that's why I love you
    And if you never have a dime
    You're still my sweet, fine, healthy baby
    And I will love you all the time
    You don't have to beg me for my loving
    Because the pleasure is all mine

    Right about now, the heartaches start calling
    Right about now, the teardrops start falling
    The late show is over and there's no place to go

    There's a lot of things you need to know
    And I don't think I'll wait for a later date
    Now's the time to let you know*

    [V]
    'Cause there's been too many nights I've waited at your door, while you run around on me
    But I got to thinking my ship started sinking and I thought I'd better swim the sea.
    So now my telephones ringing, pretty girls singing, so go ahead and run around
    It's just too much water run under the bridge and I'm too mad to come back now.

    [Ref]
    Touch my heart, feel the hurt, the pain and misery
    Then tell me again what love has done for me

    [V]
    If you lived in my world awhile, you'd soon forget how to smile
    For here there's a million ways to cry
    If you had my eyes you could see how a woman changed my destiny
    I'm a man who can't live and yet can't die

    [V]
    See these hands of mine and how they shake, my nerves are gone 'cause I can't break
    the habit of remembering yesterday
    Another love couldn't stop this ache, I know I'd make the same mistake
    Her memory’s always standing in my way

    [Full chorus]
    Touch my heart, feel the hurt, it's destroying me
    I've tried but I can't seem to shake her memory
    Touch my heart, feel the hurt, the pain and misery
    Then tell me again what love has done for me

    Trouble in mind, I'm blue

    In my backdoor some day

    My good gal she done quit me
    And it sure do agrieve my mind
    Sometimes I feel like laughing
    Other times I feel like crying

    [Solo over 12-bar blues]

    I'm goin' down to the river
    I'm gonna take my ol' rockin' chair
    And if the blues don't leave me
    I'll rock away from there.

    [Solo over verse]

    I’m gonna lay down my head
    On some lonesome railroad line
    And let the two-nineteen train
    Pacify my troubled mind

    I've been traveling over mountains
    Even through the valleys, too
    I've been traveling night and day
    I've been running all the way
    Baby, trying to get to you.

    Ever since I read your letter
    Where you said you loved me true
    I've been traveling night and day
    I've been running all the way
    baby, trying to get to you

    [B]
    When I read your loving letter
    Then my heart began to sing
    There were many miles between us,
    But they didn't mean a thing.

    I just had to reach you, baby,
    In spite of all that I've been through.
    I kept traveling night and day,
    I kept running all the way,
    Baby, trying to get to you.

    [Solo over B]

    Well if I had to do it over
    That's exactly what I'd do,
    I would travel night and day,
    And I'd still run all the way,
    Baby, trying to get to you.

    [B]
    Well, there's nothing that could hold me
    Or that could keep me away from you
    When your loving letter told me
    That you really loved me true

    Lord above me knows I love you
    It was He who brought me through,
    When my way was dark as night, 
    He would shine His brightest light,
    When I was trying to get to you.

    And the music with the laughter seem to soothe my loneliness

    She'll be dancing with a memory crying teardrops of her own

    I once played a big part in your world 
    Think back and I know you'll agree
    You still play a big part in my world
    Oh but whatever happened to me

    I made up my own excuses for so long
    I can't keep myself from asking what went wrong
    Please forgive me if I'm just too blind to see
    And tell me darling whatever happened to me

    [Solo over verse]

    Please forgive me if I'm just too blind to see
    And tell me darling whatever happened to me

    It's late and she's waiting, and I know I should go home
    But every time I start to leave, they play another song
    Then someone buys another round, and wherever drinks are free
    What's made Milwaukee famous has made a fool out of me

    [Ch]
    Baby's begged me not to go so many times before
    She says love and happiness can't live behind those swinging doors
    Now's she's gone and I'm to blame, too late I finally see
    What's made Milwaukee famous has made a loser out of me

  Lyrics: |-
    We lost 300 more today
    Is that enough?
    No hospital beds or air to breathe
    But you think you’re so tough
    -
    No price on your freedom
    But I wanna know
    When you have to write that check
    How high are you willing to go?

    [Chorus]
    Where’s your line?
    Where you’d say, “No more.” (That’s enough)
    When you’d set your pride aside, 
    And start walking the floor (and yield to somebody new)
    Where’s your line?
    Where you’d change your tune
    If you can’t draw it now, 
    I’ll be movin’ on soon

    The weight of your neighbor
    It’s not yours to hold
    Let the doctors, the mayors take that call
    So you won’t feel the cold
    -
    They send out the word
    We’ll all have to pay
    Now you’ll throw some weight around
    To hold us all at bay

    I'm the center of attention in this bar room
    ‘Cause I've got the biggest heartache of the year
    And each night those swinging doors reach out for me and draw me in
    ‘Cause they know each night that I'll come back to wine me up again

    [Ch]
    Wine me up, turn me on, and watch me cry for you
    Lately drinking warm red wine is all I want to do
    And I never know how tight I'll wine me up till I walk in
    And I don't care ‘cause I'll be back to wine me up again

    [T/A]

    [V]
    I'd like to thank the folks that raised the grapes way out in California
    And I'm hoping this year will be their biggest year
    ‘Cause scarlet water's all that's left to keep me hanging on
    And that's why I'll try to wine me up each day and night next year

    Wishing I could see you again, dear
    That the fire of love would burn once more

    Wishing that it hadn't meant goodbye
    But I guess that's wishful thinking
    Now I know why some people cry

    [Br]
    I'll just live my life in dreams and long for your love
    It's you I'm wishing for and it's you I'm thinking of

    [V]
    My heart echoes the love words you'd spoken
    How I wish I could hear them from you
    Won't you answer a heart that is broken
    And make my wishful thinking come true?

    I'll drink a little beer that evening, sing a little bit of these working man blues

    Sometimes I think about leaving, do a little bummin' around
    I want to throw my bills out the window, catch a train to another town

    You give your hand to me and then you say "Hello"

    And anyone can tell you think you know me well
    But you don't know me

    [Verse 2]
    No, you don't know the one who dreams of you each night
    And longs to kiss your lips, and longs to hold you tight
    To you I'm just a friend, that's all I've ever been
    No, you don't know me

    I never knew the art of making love, though my heart aches with love for you
    Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by, a chance that you might love me too

    You give your hand to me and then you say "Goodbye"
    And I watched you walk away beside the lucky guy
    I know you'll never know the one who loved you so
    No, you don't know me

    Your cheatin' heart will pine some day
    And crave the love you threw away
    The time will come when you'll be blue
    Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

    [Turnaround]

    [A]
    A shoulder to cry on, is all you want from me
    Someone to share your heartaches when you cry
    Someone you can depend on, who will always be around
    I'm nothing more than just your old standby

    [B]
    If you could call me darlin', if you could call me dear
    If you could learn to love me, by and by
    I wouldn't mind the waiting, for I could stand the pain
    I'd be more to you than just your old standby

    [Solo over B]

    [A]
    You wouldn't call me darlin, and you wouldn't call me dear
    I wonder if you'll miss me when I die
    You'll have no consideration, and you'll show no sympathy
    I'm nothing more than just your old standby

  Lyrics: |-
    [Int]

    [V]
    The jukebox is playing a honky tonk song
    One more I keep saying and then I'll go home
    What good would it do me, I know what I'll find
    An empty bottle, a broken heart, and you're still on my mind

    [V]
    The people are laughing and having their fun
    While I sit here crying over what you have done
    My pockets are empty, my last drink of wine,
    An empty bottle, a broken heart, and you're still on my mind

    [Solo]

    [V]
    Alone and forsaken, so blue I could die
    I just sit here drinking till the bottle runs dry
    To try and forget you I turn to the wine
    An empty bottle, a broken heart, and you're still on my mind

  Lyrics: |-
    I don't need a ship to sail the ocean
    I don't need fancy clothes to wear
    I just need your sweet, sweet lips to kiss me
    I just need your tender loving care
    Winter needs the North wind and the snowflakes
    Springtime needs the flowers soft and rare
    I just need to feel your arms around me
    I just need your tender loving care
    Day goes by so slow when you're not with me
    Nights are long and oh so hard to bear
    Everything is nothing dear without you
    And I'm nothing without your tender loving care

    You took her off my hands when you stepped in
    You changed everything, we're not even friends

    [Ch]
    Don't leave the job half-done, leave nothing behind
    You took her off my hands, now please take her off my mind

    [Br]
    Please take her photograph engraved on my heart so blue
    And take all her memories, she now belongs to you

    [Vamp on 1]

    [A]
    The news is out all over town
    That you've been seen, a-runnin' 'round
    I know that I should leave, but then
    I just can't go. You win again.

    [B]
    This heart of mine could never see
    What eveverybody knew but me
    Just trusting you was my great sin
    What can I do you win again

    [Turnaround]

    [A]
    I'm sorry for your victim now
    'Cause soon his head like mine will bow
    He'll give his heart but all in vain
    And someday say you win again.

    [B]
    You have no heart you have no shame
    You take true love and give the blame
    I guess that I should not complain
    I love you still. You win again.
